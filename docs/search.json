The fight against school segregation has direct implications for the right to education, children’s well-being, the quality of public services, and social cohesion. The city of Barcelona ranks among the Catalan cities with the highest levels of school segregation, despite also being a pioneer in developing local policies to mitigate this issue. In this context, and with the goal of addressing this challenge, the Barcelona Education Consortium launched the “Shock Plan Against School Segregation” in 2018, a groundbreaking and innovative initiative at the European level aimed at significantly reducing school segregation in the city through a wide range of measures. More recently, the approval of the new Admissions Decree by the Generalitat of Catalonia in 2021 has helped to strengthen this policy, establishing a regulatory framework that consolidates many of the measures outlined in the Shock Plan, while also introducing new instruments to improve the distribution of socially vulnerable students.\nThe main objective of this project is to determine the impact of the Shock Plan and the Admissions Decree on the distribution of socially vulnerable students across educational centers in the city of Barcelona, as well as to analyze the functioning of the various instruments introduced by these policies. The project aims to capture not only the effect of the education policy on school segregation but also how these policies are interpreted and influence the behavior of educational centers and families, and how their impact varies depending on the social, geographic, and educational context.With this objective, and by combining two complementary methodological approaches (impact evaluation and realist evaluation), the project aims to provide evidence for political decision-making and the fight against school segregation from a local perspective."

    "text": "Strand 1. Impact on school segregation and social stratification: a quasi-experimental design\nBased on the objectives of the PX and DA, three main dimensions of impact will be analysed: 1) school segregation, 2) concentration, and 3) social stratification between public and private schools.\nThe design characteristics of the PX and DA do not make it possible to apply quasi-experimental research designs involving natural experiment approaches or the comparison of similar groups. The most suitable quasi-experimental design to estimate the causality between their implementation and the evolution of school segregation is Interrupted Time Series (ITS) regression analysis – a particularly appropriate method for universal interventions or policy designs that do not allow for the identification of a control group (Lopez-Bernal, 2017). Figure 2 summarises the ITS model proposed to analyse the impact of both policies. It is hypothesised that the implementation of the PX in the school year 2019/20 produced a decrease in school segregation, concentration, and social stratification, and that this decreasing trend will even increase because of the implementation of the DA in 2021/22 and the effects produced by the interaction of these two complementary policies."

    "text": "Strand 2. Context-Mechanisms-Outcomes (CMOs): realist analysis of desegregation policies\nThe second methodological strand of the project aims to unveil how and why the two policies analysed work. To do so, the research project relies on a Context-Mechanisms-Outcomes (CMOs) approach, which is informed by the ontological and epistemological assumptions of theory-based policy evaluation, and of a realist approach in particular (Pawson & Tilley, 2004).\nThis approach assumes that policy interventions are embedded in social systems and work selectively, as they have effects depending on how people make them work. Accordingly, a realist perspective aims to capture actors’ enactment (interpretation and translation) of public policies, as well as opening the black box between policy interventions and impacts by taking into account the mediating role of the context (Astbury & Leeuw, 2010). A realist approach thus allows us to provide a more sophisticated understanding of what, how, and why PX and DA work, for whom and under what circumstances.\nThe operationalisation of the methodological approach proposed consists of breaking down an intervention into different CMOs pattern configurations that explain how policy instruments operate.\n\nContext: Includes all features and conditions in which programmes are introduced, considering that “interventions, by definition, are always inserted into pre-existing conditions” and therefore influenced by contextual constraints (Pawson, 2006: 24).\nMechanisms: Understood as the “engines of explanation in realist analysis” (Pawson, 2006: 23), describe how programmes are expected to bring particular effects.\nOutcomes: Comprise the intended and unintended consequences of programmes resulting from the activation of different mechanisms in diverse contexts."
